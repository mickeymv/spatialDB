Topic2 branch has the interface and implementation for Spatial Data types.

The three main Spatial datatypes are:
1.Point
2.Line
3.Region

A Point datatype is a collection of Poi2D (regular points)
A Line can be a simple or complex line
A region can be a simple region with/without holes or a complex region
